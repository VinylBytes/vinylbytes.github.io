    <h1>Myra</h1>

    <p>The chain of my bike rattles and rings as I round the corner. There, only barely visible through the haze, stands Myra's house, illuminated by a single wrought iron streetlight. The neighbouring buildings on the street are shrouded in abandoned darkness; all sane individuals are already fast asleep. The wet bricks of the moth-eaten road glimmer, accompanied by the smell of petrichor.</p>

    <p>My fingers, wrapped around the handlebars with the force of a vice, shudder with every pulse of my heart. The veins in my neck throb with a sickening adrenaline-fueled rhythm. Her mere existence controls me like a puppet, hijacking not just my mind but every mechanism that evolved to keep me alive. She is hard-wired into me. I imagine that the neurons of my reward circuit spell out her name. Everything guides me to Myra.</p>

    <p>I slip off my saddle and shuffle down the driveway, frantically surveying the windows like a rabbit anticipating a vulture. There, Myra lies comfortably, her silhouette outlined by the cobalt flicker of the TV. Her long blonde hair is scattered over the back of the bleak brown sofa. Shivers ripple through my body. Cold sweat clings to my skin like glue. All the individual fibres of my muscles are cramped and taut.</p>

    <p>I slide my phone out of the soft black fabric of my pocket. The LED screen springs to life like a flashbang, dazing me as I stare at our exchange again.</p>

    <p><span class="spoken">"Go for it,"</span> I mutter under my breath.</p>

    <p>My quivering hand inches towards the doorbell but freezes in midair. I command my arm to push further, and yet it hovers eerily in place. There is a profound disconnect between my body and mind. It's as if my unconscious has developed a separate free will. No matter what I do, the universe seems to pull on my strings; I'm merely starring in a cosmic tragedy for the amusement of whatever pernicious force brought it into being.</p>

    <p class="internal-dialogue">You're being ludicrous. This is what you wanted, no?</p> 
    
    <p>I gaze at the white button while my arm drifts in place.</p>
    
    <p class="internal-dialogue">If you keep up this veneer, you will lose it. You've already lost it.</p>

    <p>The pent-up emotions from the past months culminate into one final magnum opus of delusion. How can you hold such power over me? The words of Franz Kafka echo in my mind:</p>

    <blockquote>"I cannot make you understand. I cannot make anyone understand what is happening inside me. I cannot even explain it to myself."</blockquote>

    <p class="internal-dialogue">Philosophising won't save your pathetic life.</p>

    <p>A shadow leaps up in my peripheral vision, jolting my awareness away from the dizzying thought loop. My heart ushers into disorienting palpitations. My legs strain to resist the force of gravity that feels to have grown three times as potent.</p>

    <p>Myra is heading directly towards me.</p>

    <p>Her calm demeanour is in stark contrast to my mental state. Her actions seem smooth and calculated, like ripples in a still and infinite pond. Seconds meld together, and time forfeits any meaning as she approaches. Every inch she moves closer, my airway constricts, starving my brain of life-sustaining oxygen.</p>

    <p>The front door clicks open, the sudden sound grounding me milliseconds before I spiral out of control. A faint aroma of cranberry mixes with earthy undertones in the draft. I can only make out a slight figure in the stygian abyss of the hallwayâ€”yet it is unmistakably Myra.</p>

    <p>Her gaze meets mine, her predatory icy blue eyes skewering my soul like the piercing edge of an icicle. Her body rests on the doorframeâ€”a relaxed pose countered by how instigating her presence feels. She raises her eyebrows as she engages. <span class="spoken">"I can't believe you actually came,"</span> she teasesâ€”feigning surprise, but the smirk at the corner of her lips betrays her.</p>

    <p>Those words gently shatter the otherwise deafening silence at this time of night. Her voice is one of a siren, and I'm a shipwreck waiting to happen.</p>

    <p>Pulling my shoulders, I stand up straight, hoping my posture will give me the last nudge needed to regain a sliver of composure. <span class="spoken">"Well, you know me... Absurd last-minute plans are my forte,"</span> I manage to muster in my best attempt to sound nonchalant.</p>

    <p>I force a gulp of saliva down my throatâ€”straining as it passes my Adam's appleâ€”praying Myra doesn't detect the wreck beneath the persona.</p>

    <p>She yanks her head to the side, signalling me to follow her while she turns around and gently fades into the void. My feet, as if driven by a motor, pursue without delay.</p>

    <p class="internal-dialogue">If there is such a thing as a creator, and the universe isn't just one senseless deterministic pattern that began 13.8 billion years ago, please help me.</p>

    <p>The door to the living room creaks open on the bent steel hinges, welcoming a trace of warm orange light that appears metaphysical. As the passage fully opens, it reveals the panorama of a neat and spacious room I have only witnessed a handful of times before. The warm air flowing from the opening clutches my skin.</p>

    <p>To my left is a cosy seating area with a sofa and a velvety ivory armchair pivoted toward the window. Slightly to my right sits a wooden dining table laden with a pile of frayed board games. The room is lit by a singular overhead fixture, radiating a rich orange glow on the hardwood floor. A tiny flame dances on a scented candle placed neatly on the side table adorning the couch, enriching the air with conciliatory vanilla.</p>

    <p>Myra pivots in place to face me. Her stir is unhurried and deliberate. She reveals an uneasy but cordial smile that conveys little of her feelings. Her eyes, dilated and shimmering, dart toward the rightâ€”skimming family photographs on the wall beside the dinner table as if looking for guidance. <span class="spoken">"Would you like anything to drink?"</span> she chimes matter-of-factly, nervously twiddling her silver necklace between her thumb and index finger.</p>

    <p>I pat my backpack. <span class="spoken">"I actually brought us something,"</span> I remark, gauging Myra's expression.</p>

    <p>Slipping the strap from my shoulder, I set the bag on the floor between my legs. My hand emerges from the main compartment with a medium-sized bottle. It has a marble-like texture embellished with bevelled text and a silver label.</p>

    <p><span class="spoken">"Beerenburg,"</span> I express, my voice wavering, <span class="spoken">"because I could use some Dutch courage right about now."</span></p>

    <p>Myra's eyes widen at the sight as she leans in. This is typical for her, but I can never quite decipher her underlying emotions. Nothing moves, not even a hair, while she appears paralysed by her thoughtsâ€”a perfect mirror of my indecision.</p>

    <p class="internal-dialogue">Oh great, you've wrecked this before it even started. Cycling into a ditch on my way here would have been less painful.</p>
